# notpy-interpreter
This repository contains the source code and the documentation of the programming language "Notpy" for which we built the interpreter as a part of our Compilers course at IIT Gandhinagar under the professor Balagopal Komarath.
<br>
We have used the codes written by professor in the class(present at repo: Balu/sim) and built our interpreter on top of it.
